## Features

The Rust_Webapp comes with the following features:

1. CRUD Operations: The web application supports all four CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data it manages.

### CRUD Operations

With the CRUD operations implemented, you can perform the following tasks:

1. Create: Add new data entries to the web application.
2. Read: Retrieve and view existing data entries.
3. Update: Modify and update existing data entries.
4. Delete: Remove data entries from the web application.

These CRUD operations enable users to interact with the web application and manage its data effectively.

## Requirements

- Rust (stable version) - [Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Axs7941/Rust_Webapp.git
cd Rust_Webapp
```

2. Build the project:

```bash
cargo build
```

## Usage

To run the Rust_Webapp project using Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

2. Install the "CodeLLDB" extension if you haven't already. This extension allows you to debug your Rust code within VSCode.

3. Press `F5` or go to the "Run" menu and select "Start Debugging". This will build and run the application in debug mode.

4. Once the application is running, you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8000` (or another port if specified).

5. To stop the application, either close the terminal running the application or press `Shift + F5` in VSCode.
